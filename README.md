# wp4-queries-geo
This repo contains examples of geo-queries (best executed in https://yasgui.org in order to show the query result directly on a map). Copy-paste a query and endpoint in [Yasgui](https://yasgui.org) to retrieve results. Check out this [example](https://api.druid.datalegend.net/s/Fu5WzdPHp) or [this one](https://bit.ly/2ODxXUv).

You can also directly execute the queries via [grlc](http://grlc.io/api/CLARIAH/wp4-queries-geo/), but then you miss out on the eye candy.
